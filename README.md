# Angular2 Domoticz Service demonstration
Domoticz service which deploys Observable techniques to watch for changes.

Including API calls to alter some aspects of the server (not all).

Wrapped in Ionic 2 demo app (sidemenu).

## Important!
Use at own discretion, but if you have any suggestion, let me know.

## Getting Started
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tommertom/ng2domoticz.git`.
* Run `npm install` from the project root.
* Install the ionic CLI and Cordova (`npm install -g ionic@latest cordova@latest`)
* Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.

Due to cross-origin restrictions, this actually won't work in a browser. So you need to `ionic run android` or `ionic run ios` to a device 
or upload in ionic view to see it working.

This demo is available in Ionic View under app ID `96ecbaf2`. Download Ionic View in the app store, register free 
Ionic account and enjoy.
